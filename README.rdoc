## Apollo Assignment: Designing a Blog Data Model

We need to store the following pieces of information:

An author including their contact information
* A blog entry
* A comment
* A category

Model the data that is important to each item, one model at a time. Think about typical blog systems and what you might want to store as part of blogging software.
